Pomodoro Timer Made Using JavaFX

Instructor/Code: Craig Dennis </br>
Designer: Susan

Current Status: Will continue to make out of project modifications such as suggesting
"study breaks" with videos that fit into the 5 minute break span, etc.

Comments: This is my first introduction to the JavaFX framework and building a JavaFX
application is just like Android Development not only in that I'm using IntelliJ to
make it but also because XML (FXML in this case) is used for view, a controller class
controls the view, and a main class serves as the model.

What I Learned: This project really solidified in me the idea of the MVC design pattern
that I definitely did not follow 2 years ago when I first got into Java and Android developement.

Date Course Finished: 9/13/2017
